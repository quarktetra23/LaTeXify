**Overview**\
This project centers around the development of "LaTeXify", a browser extension designed to enhance the workflow of LaTeX users. The primary function of LaTeXify is to allow for the selection of web content and its subsequent conversion into LaTeX format. This tool is tailored to assist a wide range of users, from students and academics to professionals, in seamlessly integrating web content into LaTeX documents.

**Motivation**\
Typing an equation in latex takes a lot of time, especially when you mess something up and then document does not compile anymore. LLM's are very useful for lazy people. 


**Key Features**
- Content Selection: Enables users to select specific areas on a webpage for processing.
- LaTeX Conversion: Converts the selected content into LaTeX code efficiently.
- Clipboard Integration: Facilitates easy copying of the converted LaTeX code to the clipboard for use in various applications.
- User-Centric Interface: Emphasizes a straightforward and intuitive interface to enhance user experience.

**Development Phase**\
The extension is currently open to development and welcomes feedback and new feature suggestions!
